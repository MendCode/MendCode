# Changelog

## 0.1.2 - 2026-06-13

- Publish MendCode under the `mendcode` command name and remove the public `mend` package alias.
- Normalize source and package metadata to `0.1.2` after the public `v0.1.1` release.
- Show the MendCode runtime version in welcome, CLI, debug info, health responses, and Zed extension metadata.
- Keep update checks on `MendCode/MendCode` GitHub releases and skip autoupdate for local/source builds.
- Preserve offline startup by treating update lookup failures as non-blocking.
- Replace user-facing `mend` and `mend-runtime` command hints with `mendcode`.
